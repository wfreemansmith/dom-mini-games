# DOM Mini-Games

For this project I created a suite of mini-games using only HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I wanted to write an app using only direct DOM manipulation without reliance on external frameworks or libraries.

Games currently available:
- Noughts and Crosses
- Matching Pairs
- More on their way...

On loading, the site chooses a random game for you, and games can be toggled between by using the left and right arrow keys. Double click the heading to randomise selection.

Features implemented soon:
- Dark mode toggle
- Additional games
- Touch API / canvas for mobile
- Keypad control of games
