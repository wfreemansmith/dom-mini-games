# DOM Mini-Games

For this project I created a suite of mini-games using only HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I wanted to write an app using direct DOM manipulation without reliance on external frameworks or libraries.

Games currently available:
- Noughts and Crosses
- Matching Pairs
- More on their way...

There is a hosted version of the site here: https://noughts-wfs.netlify.app/

## Features

On loading, the site chooses a random game for you. Players can navigate between games by using the left and right arrow keys (in-browser and via keyboard).

Dark mode can be toggled on and off by using the ☀️ icon on the top right corner of the screen or by pressing the `Tab` key. On mobile, you can tap the header to the same effect.

Features implemented soon:
- Additional games
- Touch API / canvas for mobile
- Keypad control of games

## Local set-up

Before installing locally, ensure that you have as a minumum requirement Node v19.2.0 set up on your system.

To clone this repo to your computer, navigate to the desired destination on your system and type ```git clone https://github.com/wfreemansmith/nc-news-front-end.git``` into the command line. There are no dependencies to install.

## Credits

The site was created from a sprint designed by [Northcoders](www.northcoders.com). The code for Noughts & Crosses was originally written with fellow student Zahed Miah -- [Github](https://github.com/zahedmiah).
