# DOM Mini-Games

For this project I created a suite of mini-games using only HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. I wanted to write an app using direct DOM manipulation without reliance on external frameworks or libraries.

Games currently available:
- Noughts and Crosses
- Matching Pairs
- Simon Says

There is a hosted version of the site here: https://noughts-wfs.netlify.app/

## Features

On loading, the site chooses a random game for you. Players can navigate between games by using the left and right arrow keys (in-browser and via keyboard).

Dark mode can be toggled on and off by using the ☀️ icon on the top right corner of the screen or by pressing the `Tab` key. On mobile, you can tap the header to the same effect.

On desktop the background hue can be cycled through by using the mousewheel, or using two fingers on a trackpad. You can revert to the original colour scheme by double-clicking the reset button.

Features implemented soon:
- Keypad control of games
- Increased touch functionality for mobile

The site was created from a sprint designed by [Northcoders](www.northcoders.com). The code for Noughts & Crosses was originally written with fellow student Zahed Miah -- [Github](https://github.com/zahedmiah).
